## What I've been up to
* I've created and maintained the repo and asana
* Added default colour variables to the styles.css file
* Ensured all html files are well organised with links to the google fonts, all respective style sheets and javascript files (including bootstrap and jQuery)
* I've created and styled the landing page complete with a nav bar that's used on all other pages, cards with buttons to the other pages too along with a description
* Started work on meals.html, including a bottom nav bar that pops up with a section to select certain criteria you want when searching for a meal
* Created and finished the streaming-services.html page which will be used by the user to select which streaming services they want to see availability from when they're looking for movies, utilising localStorage to remember their choice

## What I'm planning to do next
I plan to omplete the meals page by this Monday, I aim to have 2 different pages available to the user - a page with random meal suggestions that loads upon startup, a search results page where you get meals based on your search, both of these pages will be affected by the various filters offered to the user with the bottom nav bar, the filters are as follows: dietary requirements (either things like allergies, or choices such as vegetarianism), included ingredients (just simply a list of ingredients they want included in the meal) *this one may be harder than anticipated depending on the results of the GET request*, search meals by first letter, so you can enter the name of your significant other and it will return results based on the first letter of their name.
